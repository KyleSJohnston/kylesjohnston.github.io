# About

My most recent role was in quantitative finance at a hedge fund. I’m experimenting with Julia, and I’m convinced the two-language problem is worth solving most of the time.

I enjoy applying data and analytics to the sports world. I’m a fan of all the Boston teams—Patriots, Bruins, Celtics and RedSox.
